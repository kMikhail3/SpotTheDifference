# SpotTheDifference
Proof of concept for the sum of absolute differences in image processing.
Automatically sorts a dataset of pictures by day/night and moves them to the appropriate folders. 
A smoothening filter is applied to each picture and the sum of absolute differences is taken by OpenCV. 

Picture 1. and 2. have the smoothening filter applied. Picture 3 illustrates the pixel-by-pixel difference.
